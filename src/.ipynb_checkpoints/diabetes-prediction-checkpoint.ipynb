    "# Diabetes Prediction and Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the researchers' aim are to investigate and predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals by leveraging a publicly available dataset. The researchers' approach involves conducting comprehensive exploratory data analysis, comparing key health metrics between diabetic and non-diabetic groups, and developing machine learning models for prediction. The primary objective is to identify significant health indicators linked to diabetes and to construct reliable models that can support early detection efforts.\n"

    "    age \n",
    "        -> an important factor as diabetes is more commonly diagnosed in older adults.Age ranges from 0-80 in our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "    hypertension \n",
    "        -> medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated. It has values a 0 or 1 where 0 indicates they don’t have hypertension and for 1 it means they have hypertension.\n",
    "\n",
    "    heart_disease\n",
    "         -> another medical condition that is associated with an increased risk of developing diabetes. It has values a 0 or 1 where 0 indicates they don’t have heart disease and for 1 it means they have heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "    smoking_history\n",
    "         -> considered a risk factor for diabetes and can exacerbate the complications associated with diabetes.In our dataset we have 5 categories i.e not current,former,No Info,current,never and ever.\n",

    "    bmi (Body Mass Index)\n",
    "         -> a measure of body fat based on weight and height. Higher BMI values are linked to a higher risk of diabetes. The range of BMI in the dataset is from 10.16 to 71.55. BMI less than 18.5 is underweight, 18.5-24.9 is normal, 25-29.9 is overweight, and 30 or more is obese. \n",

    "    HbA1c_level (Hemoglobin A1c)\n",
    "         -> measure of a person's average blood sugar level over the past 2-3 months. Higher levels indicate a greater risk of developing diabetes. Mostly more than 6.5% of HbA1c Level indicates diabetes.\n",
